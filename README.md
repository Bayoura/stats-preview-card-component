## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to do a tint using mix-blend-mode. In general, I also learned how to work with a style-guide and design references.

### Continued development

I think I should learn a little bit more about creating responsive images. As of now, it's a lot of trial and error. Also, I feel that I could be more efficient when it comes to using Flexbox. Furthermore I should start getting more comfortable with CSS Grid, since I haven't really used it, yet.
